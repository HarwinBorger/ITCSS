# ITCSS BOILERPLATE 

This is an ITCSS boilerplate which represents a map/file structure you can use to setup new ITCSS projects.

## Numeric
Each ITCSS folder has a numeric prefix so it shown in the right order and easier to find. 

## Double underscore files
The main file in each ITCSS folder contains a double underscore so it is always shown on top. From this main file you can import other SCSS files.
